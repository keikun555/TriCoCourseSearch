From analyzing menu and ingredient translations to producing a short film based on interviews, we will consider the relationship between food and communication in a multilingual and multicultural world.

We will watch and analyze films together, read canonical essays in the field, and we will also produce short films; we will treat production as research.

Course content varies.; Current topic description: This seminar places the question of space at the center of late 19th through early 21st century histories of maternity care, examining maternity-ward and maternity-hospital architecture in order to gain greater insight into the ways in which the built environment has historically instantiated cultural beliefs about childbirth, gender, and perceptions of risk and safety surrounding the maternal-fetal dyad. While historians of twentieth-century maternity care have looked at birth\u0092s relocation from homes to hospitals, as well as changing practices within hospitals, there has been no sustained investigation into the architecture of the maternity hospital itself and the ways in which it may have supported and reified changes in childbirth practices.  This seminar will explore the notion that in order to understand and historically situate the often controversial use of technologies in maternity care - from early-20th century x-rays, to forceps, to contemporary ultrasound and fetal heart monitoring \u0096 and the role they have played in transforming cultural attitudes towards pregnancy and towards pregnant women, we must examine the sites within which technology-based practices were first developed and deployed \u0096 the research-focused maternity hospital.
