Enrollment limited to 15 students, Senior linguistics majors only.; ; ****; Long Description:; ; The Senior Thesis Seminar has been offered only at Swarthmore for all Tri-Co seniors in our department up to this point. With the growing number of Bi-Co students majoring in Linguistics, including Linguistics and Language, and with our Tri-Co linguist on tenure track at Haverford, it is now time to offer a section of the thesis seminar at Haverford. The number for the section is capped at 7 because that is the maximum number of theses each faculty member involved in the seminar will be supervising. Swarthmore will keep multiple sections of the seminar. Given our practice of assigning first and second readers of the thesis after senior majors have decided on the thesis topic in the beginning of the fall semester, we envision this section at Haverford as a course \"shell\" which is open to any senior major in our department, including Swarthmore students, once it is decided that their thesis topic is most closely aligned with Brook Lillehaugen's expertise. My counterpart at Swarthmore, David Harrison, has been directly involved in the discussions about the desirability and feasibility of opening such a section at Haverford, and is strongly in favor of it. If you still have questions about this proposal in the context of our being a Tri-Co department (still the first and only), I will be very happy to answer your questions to your satisfaction.
