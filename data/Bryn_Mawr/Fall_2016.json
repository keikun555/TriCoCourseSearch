And what\u0092s with W.G. Sebald\u0092s crossing the lines betweenmemoir and novel? In this course we will use close readings of a groupof stories, novels, essays, and films that blur the lines separatingnonfiction and fiction--in form and in content--to make inquiry intothe nature of the dialectics of the reporting of empirical facts,memory and storytelling.

A range of texts, drawn from biology, foodscience, political science, psychology, and government webpages, willprovide the foundation for us to consider how various stakeholdersinfluence the act of eating.

Doesresistance necessarily involve violence? Do acts of resistance need tobe visible and openly defiant or can they be secret and covert? Usingthe French Resistance to the Nazi occupation of France during WorldWar II as its primary case study, this seminar explores the concept of\u0093resistance\u0094 from numerous perspectives.  We will explore topics andthemes including violence, sabotage, and guerrilla warfare; censorshipand the underground press; cultural and intellectual resistance;gender, sexuality, and espionage; small acts of resistance in everydaylife; and the complicated legacy of collaboration and resistance inFrench memory and national identity after the war.  We will examine awide variety of sources in the French context: memoirs, diaries, andpoems written by resistance fighters; the 2015 film Suite Fran\u00e7aise;news articles and cartoons published in the secret underground press;Vercours\u0092 short story The Silence of the Sea; film footage ofsabotage; and the oral testimonies of rural villagers who hid FrenchJews from the Gestapo.  In order to think through the complexities of\u0093resistance\u0094 as an analytical concept, we will also read scholarshipfrom a variety of other disciplines, including the work of politicalscientist James C. Scott, sociologist Jocelyn Hollander, philosopherFrantz Fanon, and novelist George Orwell.

These ideas developed in a short but intensely creative period of literary and cultural history spanning from the 1790s to the 1820s. This is an age of political upheaval, scientific discovery, and social revolution. We will foreground our discussion of these radical transformations in art and politics by reading the prose of Edmund Burke, Mary Wollstonecraft, and William Godwin. We will then examine the rise of Romanticism in the poetry of William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge by focusing on their groundbreaking text _Lyrical Ballads_. We will use this poetry to define the power of what these writers called the \u0093imagination.\u0094 The course will then turn toward the later Romantics, who responded to these artistic and political ideals in surprising ways. Readings may include Percy By sshe Shelley\u0092s _The Cenci_, John Keats\u0092s Odes, and Lord Byron\u0092s _Childe Harold\u0092s Pilgrimage_.

There is no other example of migration with more than 100 years of history. The copious presence of migrants concentrated in a host country, such as we have in the case of the 11.7 million Mexican migrants residing in the United States, along with another 15 million Mexican descendants, is unparalleled. The 1,933-mile-long border shared by the two countries makes it one of the longest boundary lines in the world and, unfortunately, also one of the most dangerous frontiers in the world today. We will examine the different economic, political, social and cultural forces that have shaped this centenarian migration influx and undertake a macro-, meso-, and micro-levels of analysis. At the macro-level of political economy, we will investigate the economic interdependency that has developed between Mexico and the U.S. over different economic development periods of these countries, particularly, the role the Mexican labor force has played to boosting and sustaining both the Mexican and the American economies. At the meso-level, we will examine different institutions both in Mexico and the U.S. that have determined the ways in which millions of Mexican migrate to this country. Last, but certainly not least, we will explore the impacts that both the macro-and meso-processes have had on the micro-level by considering the imperatives, aspirations, and dreams that have prompted millions of people to leave their homes and communities behind in search of better opportunities. This major life decision of migration brings with it a series of social transformations in family and community networks, this will look into the cultural impacts in both the sending and receiving migrant communities.
