We try to clarify the issues relevant to these questions by looking at the contemporary debates about the role of automation and digital media and the problem of climate change. These debates raise many questions including: the appropriate model of scientific inquiry (is there a single model for science?, how is science both experimental and deductive?, is science merely trial and error?, is science objective?, is science value-free?), the ideological standing of science (has science become a kind of ideology?), the autonomy of technology (have the rapidly developing technologies escaped our power to direct them?), the politics of science (is science somehow essentially democratic?, and are \"scientific\" cultures more likely to foster democracy?, or is a scientific culture essentially elitist and autocratic?), the relation of science to the formation of public policy (experts rule?, are we in or moving toward a technocracy?), the role of technology and science in the process of modernization, Westernization, and globalization (what role has science played in industrialization and what role does it now play in a post-industrial world?). To find an appropriate way to consider these questions, we look at the pairing of science with democracy in the Enlightenment project and study contemporary work in the philosophy of science, political science, and ethics.\nApproach: Critical Interpretation (CI), Inquiry into the Past (IP);,  ; Haverford: Humanities (HU)\n This course is part of a 360 cluster.", "Registration ID": "PHILB238001", "Miscellaneous Links": "Departmental Homepage\nBook Prices", "Credit": "1.00", "Semester": "Fall_2017", "Lab Sections": "", "Department": "Philosophy", "Instructor": "Dostal,Robert J.", "CRN": "1993", "Campus": "Bryn_Mawr", "Description": "\"Science, Technology, and the Good Life\" considers the relation of science and technology to each other and to everyday life, particularly with respect to questions of ethics and politics.
