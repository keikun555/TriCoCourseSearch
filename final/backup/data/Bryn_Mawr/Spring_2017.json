From a\nscientific perspective, we will focus on the core scientific\nprincipals related to Cosmology, Physics, Biology and Geology that\naddress fundamental questions regarding the origins of the universe,\ntime, stars, the Earth, and its inhabitants. The scientific\nperspective will be balanced by the humanist view, though which we\nwill examine cultural and historical expressions of the problem of\n\"beginning\u0094, paying close attention to Dine (Navajo) and\nGreco-Roman/Christian cultural narratives, and contemporary Science\nFiction fantasies about origin. 360 Application: https://www.brynmawr.edu/academics/special-academic-programs/360-course-clusters/upcoming-clusters/fall-2016-application-2", "Registration ID": "BIOLB236001", "Miscellaneous Links": "Departmental Homepage\nBook Prices", "Credit": "1.00", "Semester": "Spring_2017", "Lab Sections": "", "Department": "Biology", "Instructor": "Davis,Gregory K.\nMarenco,Pedro J.", "CRN": "1031", "Campus": "Bryn_Mawr", "Description": "A lecture/discussion course on the development of evolutionary biology.

Typed functional programming languages are quickly gaining currency in industry, including at Google, Facebook, a variety of financial services companies, and across a range of startups.

Elegies are crucial for our understanding of literary history because in addition to coping with individual loss they address larger themes and problems about literature, including what form mourning should take in verse. These poems range from meditating on the vision of someone dying to lamenting the loss of a fellow poet, and they take on excruciating subjects such as the loss of a child or coming to terms with the violent death of a beloved person. An elegy can be both intensely personal and political, forcing us to confront our own mortality and the grief of others.

Our readings will address a wide array of social and cultural contexts from the problem of faith in the Victorian period to the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s. We will also consider how the genre of elegy extends beyond poetic form to include narrative and memoir.

We will also read some critical theory that explains how valuing the mind over the body, the human over the animal, has been used to support racism, sexism, and colonialism--and has led to the destruction of the ecological system.  The course will include both works that present the social, political, and biological horrors resulting from the separation of the non-human from the human, and works that imagine humans merging with nature.  The reading in the course will include selections from books of \u0093materialist\u0094 theory (such as Jane Bennett\u0092s Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things),  novels (Djuna Barnes, Nightwood, Franz Kafka, Metamorphosis), nonfiction (Annie Dillard, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek), and movies (Ousmane Sembene, Xala, James Cameron, Avatar)."}, {"Time And Days": "T 7:00pm-10:00pm", "Course Title": "Literature and Visual Culture", "Room Location": "EHII", "Additional Course Info": "Class Number: 2431\nThis course examines the complex and mutually-informing relationship between literature and images, especially in the nineteenth through twenty-first centuries. We will read broadly in visual culture to elucidate not only written texts, but also photographs, films, paintings, and graphic narratives. We will also consider images that are invisible or that cannot otherwise be seen. Our investigation will begin with questions that are both imaginative and ethical: How does a Victorian poem help us to understand the photographs taken by a contemporary serial killer? What can we see in the literary description of an image that cannot be seen in the image itself? Should we look at the last moments of a human life? The syllabus is divided into a series of foundational thematic units. We will begin the semester thinking about sight and how to look at an image in terms of narrative. To this end, we will read an account written by an art model who describes her experience of posing nude, a narrative that will inform our work with Laura Mulvey's influential essay, \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema.\" This theoretical grounding in the gaze and its troubling power will help us to confront Robert Browning's dramatic monologues read with and against photographs taken by criminals. Our next unit will focus on definitions of reality and objectivity in images and narrative accounts of the Holocaust. Readings might include Primo Levi\u0092s The Drowned and the Saved, Art Spiegelman\u0092s Maus, Marianne Hirsch\u0092s The Generation of Postmemory, Susan Sontag\u0092s Regarding the Pain of Others, and Georges Didi-Huberman\u0092s Images in Spite of All. We then consider the problem of representation by drawing on the tradition of poetic ekphrasis to think about visualizing art in literature by John Keats, P. B. Shelley, W. H. Auden, Adam Kirsch, and Natasha Trethewey. Our next unit takes us into the media of reproduction, and we read Walter Benjamin and Roland Barthes along with a novel by W. G. Sebald. Our discussion continues as we address spectacle, surveillance, and consumption in the imagery and literature created in the aftermath of September 11th, including Art Spiegelman's In the Shadow of No Towers, W.

How do psychologists study and treat psychopathology?  How is psychopathology experienced by individuals?  What causes psychological difficulties and what are their consequences?  How do we integrate social, biological and psychological perspectives on the causes of psychopathology?   Do psychological treatments (therapies) work?  How do we study the effectiveness of psychology treatments?
