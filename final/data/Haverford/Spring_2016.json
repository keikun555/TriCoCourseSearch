How does scientific knowledge inform and influence literature? How do scientific texts make use of literary strategies and rhetorical devices in order to produce and disseminate new knowledge? Bringing together primary texts from the history of science with key literary works from Goethe to cyberpunk, this seminar will introduce students to the interdisciplinary study of relations between science and literature. Despite disciplinary divisions, literature and the sciences converge strikingly in terms of their shared objects of inquiry, theoretical assumptions, and representational strategies. We will investigate how foundational concepts in the fields of chemistry, biology, physics, psychology, and cybernetics have profoundly shaped modern fiction.

We will first scrutinize colonial efforts by individual German states before the first unification of Germany in 1871, and then investigate the colonialism of Imperial Germany. In particular, we will focus on the time after the 1884/1885 Berlin Conference that sought to regulate the so-called \u0093Scramble for Africa\u0094 and explore how the First World War was related to Germany\u0092s colonial ambitions. Moreover, we will engage with the parallel development of the German national and colonial project and the Social Darwinist thinking that influenced and contributed to the racialization of German national identity.; Cross-listed: German, Comparative Literature Humanities (HU)"}, {"Time And Days": "", "Course Title": "Senior Conference", "Room Location": "", "Additional Course Info": "Class Number: 1917\n Humanities (HU)", "Registration ID": "GERMH399B001", "Miscellaneous Links": "Link to Departmental Homepage\nBook Prices", "Credit": "1.00", "Semester": "Spring_2016", "Lab Sections": "", "Department": "German", "Instructor": "Schoenherr,Ulrich\nBrust,Imke\nHenkel,Brook N.", "CRN": "1917", "Campus": "Haverford", "Description": "Humanities (HU)"}, {"Time And Days": "MWF 9:30am-10:30am,TTH 9:00am-10:00am", "Course Title": "Elementary Greek", "Room Location": "HLL112,HLL112", "Additional Course Info": "Class Number: 1793\nCompletion of the basics of ancient Greek, followed by readings in Lysias and Plato.
