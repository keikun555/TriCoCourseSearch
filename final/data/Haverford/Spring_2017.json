This course is aimed at understanding the chemistry of lead and how that chemistry has spawned apparently useful products (anti-knock gasoline additives, paints, and water pipes, for instance) that degrade in and contaminate the environment and result in neurological and other impairments through interactions with human biochemistry.  Although the primary focus will be on the chemistry, we will also discuss the evidence for public health effects and the various remediation strategies, as well as political debates about governmental, corporate and individual responsibility for engaging in such remediation. Students will be expected to lead and participate in discussions of primary and secondary literature papers and (in weekly homework assignments) to provide written summaries of and responses to these papers.; Prerequisite(s): Three semesters of Chemistry, through CHEM 222; Crosslisted: CHEM and ENVS Natural Science (NA)"}, {"Time And Days": "", "Course Title": "Research Tutorial in Physical Chemistry", "Room Location": "", "Additional Course Info": "Class Number: 1671\nDirected research in physical chemistry, condensed phase chemical physics, and biophysical chemistry, with emphasis on spectroscopic studies of site-specific environmental and conformational dynamics in peptides and proteins.; Prerequisite: Consent Natural Science (NA)", "Registration ID": "CHEMH361B001", "Miscellaneous Links": "Link to Departmental Homepage\nBook Prices", "Credit": "2.00", "Semester": "Spring_2017", "Lab Sections": "", "Department": "Chemistry", "Instructor": "Londergan,Casey H", "CRN": "1671", "Campus": "Haverford", "Description": "Directed research in physical chemistry, condensed phase chemical physics, and biophysical chemistry, with emphasis on spectroscopic studies of site-specific environmental and conformational dynamics in peptides and proteins.; Prerequisite: Consent Natural Science (NA)"}, {"Time And Days": "", "Course Title": "Research Tutorial in Theoretical Chemistry", "Room Location": "", "Additional Course Info": "Class Number: 1672\nDirected research in computational and theoretical physical chemistry, with emphasis on development and application of methods for prediction of optical, electronic, and mechanical properties of organic and inorganic semiconductor nanostructures.; Prerequisite: Consent.
