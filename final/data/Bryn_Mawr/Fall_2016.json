How do we read George Orwell\u0092s account of seeing a\nman executed by hanging differently if Orwell actually witnessed the\nevent--or if it was \u0093only a story,\u0094 as he claimed long after \u0093The\nHanging\u0094 was published? How can reading both the fictional accounts of\nthe Russian Red Cavalry found in Isaac Babel\u0092s Red Cavalry Stories and\nearlier accounts of the same events found in Babel\u0092s diaries help us\nunderstand why some writers of war narratives present their texts as\nnonfiction, while others write fiction clearly derived from first-hand\nexperience? And what\u0092s with W.G. Sebald\u0092s crossing the lines between\nmemoir and novel? In this course we will use close readings of a group\nof stories, novels, essays, and films that blur the lines separating\nnonfiction and fiction--in form and in content--to make inquiry into\nthe nature of the dialectics of the reporting of empirical facts,\nmemory and storytelling.

In this seminar, we\nwill investigate these questions by exploring a variety of\nautobiographical, fictional, and cinematic treatments of radical\npersonal transformation spanning from biblical times to the\ntwenty-first century. Our readings will include classic spiritual\nautobiographies such as Augustine\u0092s Confessions and John Bunyan\u0092s\nGrace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners, more recent memoir accounts\nlike Soul on Ice, a collection of essays written by Black Panther\nleader Eldridge Cleaver while he was incarcerated at Folsom State\nPrison, and Kate Bornstein\u0092s A Queer and Pleasant Danger, which traces\nthe author\u0092s encounters with the Church of Scientology and zir journey\nfrom male to female to gender noncomformist, and fictional\nrepresentations of conversions in works such as Leo Tolstoy\u0092s The\nDeath of Ivan Il\u0092ich  and Herman Hesse\u0092s Siddhartha.

Is it the simple depiction of atrocities either\nthrough a visual medium or a written text? What other stories or\nmessages do these texts carry? Are there other stories or narratives?\nOther perspectives? Has this representation changed through history?\nWhat are the ethical implications of engaging with texts that try to\ntell the \u0093truth\u0094 about war?
