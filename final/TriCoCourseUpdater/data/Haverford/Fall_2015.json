All linguistics majors must write their senior thesis in this seminar or Ling S100 or S195. Enrollment limited to 15 students, Senior linguistics majors only.; ; ****; Long Description:; ; The Senior Thesis Seminar has been offered only at Swarthmore for all Tri-Co seniors in our department up to this point. With the growing number of Bi-Co students majoring in Linguistics, including Linguistics and Language, and with our Tri-Co linguist on tenure track at Haverford, it is now time to offer a section of the thesis seminar at Haverford. The number for the section is capped at 7 because that is the maximum number of theses each faculty member involved in the seminar will be supervising. Swarthmore will keep multiple sections of the seminar. Given our practice of assigning first and second readers of the thesis after senior majors have decided on the thesis topic in the beginning of the fall semester, we envision this section at Haverford as a course \"shell\" which is open to any senior major in our department, including Swarthmore students, once it is decided that their thesis topic is most closely aligned with Brook Lillehaugen's expertise. My counterpart at Swarthmore, David Harrison, has been directly involved in the discussions about the desirability and feasibility of opening such a section at Haverford, and is strongly in favor of it. If you still have questions about this proposal in the context of our being a Tri-Co department (still the first and only), I will be very happy to answer your questions to your satisfaction.

The first half of the course will relate principles of argument and composition to principles of textual analysis. A good reader can analyze the logic of an argument, the style of its presentation, and the way it solicits its audience. Similarly, the good writer understands her audience, adopts a style appropriate to the situation, and crafts an argument that establishes grounds for possible agreement. A good writer is a better reader. For example, in Act II, scene ii of Hamlet Polonius wastes time while saying he won't: \"since brevity is the soul of wit / And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes / I will be brief\" He can't even speak briefly of brevity but follows his aphorism with a redundant flourish of his own. Like Polonius, when you present your reader with tedious prose you present yourself as tedious. And though few occasions warrant such a presentation, this course will supply students with the power to suit their words to different occasions and the power to read how others in turn both craft themselves and either succeed or fail to convince.The second half of the course will consider the relation between experience and language, between our world and our words. Using the analytic tools assembled during the first half, we will examine works of philosophy and literature that seek to define this relation. Texts will include, Plato's Gorgias, Friedrich Nietzsche's early essay, \"On Truth and Lying in an Extra-moral Sense,\" and Toni Morrison's novel, Sula.
